👋 Hi, I'm Piotr Szefer
I'm a data scientist and research analyst with a strong background in ecology, machine learning, and statistical modeling. I specialize in building analytical tools that bridge science and technology—turning data into insights and automating complex research workflows.

With years of hands-on experience in ecological research, I've transitioned into data science and machine learning engineering, focusing on projects that involve natural language processing, generative AI, and dashboard development. I work with Python, R, SQL, and modern web tools like Streamlit and React.
